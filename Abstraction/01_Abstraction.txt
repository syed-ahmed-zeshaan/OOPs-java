x---------------------------------------------------ABSTRACTION---------------------------------------------------------x

Process of hiding sensitive details and only showing the required details to the user is called as ABSTRACTION

ex:-In order to start a casr, you only need to press on the ognition but dont need to know how the internal combustion
  engine works

Similarly,Abstraction is a concept that helps us to define what a class does, intead of how to does.(Like a car switching on,
insteading of knowing how)

Focus on "What" instead of "how"

Abstraction of classes could be implemented by the following:-
        1.Abstract classes
        2.Interfaces
