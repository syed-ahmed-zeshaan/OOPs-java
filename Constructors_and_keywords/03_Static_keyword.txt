x---------------------------------------------------STATIC KEYWORD---------------------------------------------------------x

When a member of a class is declared to static,it can be accessed before any object of th said class is created.
->Both attributes and functions can be declared to static
->Ex:-Main function
        in every program psvm is the entry point of the program,which is declared inside a class.we need to accessed
        psvm before any object of the parent class is created for the program to execute,hence we use the static KEYWORD

->Static keyword belongs to the class and not the object
->static members can access only static members
->static members can not access non static members
->A non static member belongs to the object.and a static member referencing to a non static member before the object is created makes no sense.
->non static members can access both static and non static members
->static members hence cant access "this" keyword
->static methods can be directly accessed by class name
ex:-
        public class Program8 {
            static int a=4;
            static int b;
            static void random(int x){
                System.out.println("a="+a);
                System.out.println("b="+b);
                System.out.println("x="+x);
            }
            static{
                System.out.println("Static block initialised");
                b=a*4;
            }
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                random(42);
            }
            
        }
o/p:-Static block initialised
a=4
b=16
x=42

understanding the program
->Static statements are run first as soon as the class is loaded.So first a is set to 4,then static block initialises b to a*4.Then main
does its thing
