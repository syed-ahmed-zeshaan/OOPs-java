    For the follwing case
                                        Box[l,b,h]
                                             |
                                        boxWeight[w]

    The following are a few valid syntax

               1. Box box=new Box();✔

               2. BoxWeight box=new BoxWeight();✔

IMPORTANT****  3. Box box=new BoxWeight();✔

                    Even this is valid.
                    Question:?
                            Why is this valid'
                    Answer:
                                                refered class
                                            -------------
                                 Box box=new BoxWeight();
                                 --------
                                    |
                                 referencing class

                            ->In this case,the reference variable is of the type of Box(Super class) and the object created/constructor called 
                                 is of the type BoxWeight(Subclass).
                                 *All the memebrs of the "referencing class" must be initialised for a valid object creation,which in this
                                 case is happening as the sub class(box weight) calls the constructor of super class(box)
                                 !Hence it is a valid syntaxx

                                 This is called UPCASTING.

                            ->Hence all members of super class can be accessed

                                    syso(box.l)✔
                                    syso(box.b)✔
                                    syso(box.h)✔

                                    syso(box.w)❌,ERROR

                                    WHY>?
                                    "What members can be accessed is dependent on the reference variable, and not the type of
                                    object created"

                                    Since the reference variable is of the Super class it cant access the members of the subclass.
                
                
                4. BoxWeight box=new Box();❌,ERROR
                            WHY?
                                Here the referencing class is of the type of subclass,and the object is of the type super class.
                                Not all memebrs of the referencing class which in this case is the Sub class are initialised as the
                                object that we are trying to create is of the super class, and super class doesnt have access to the members 
                                of the sub class
                                hence this is invalid declaration


SUMMARY:-

        1.in java you can have a super class reference and a subclass object(Upcasting)
        2.in java you cant have a sub class reference and a super class object(Invalid reference)
