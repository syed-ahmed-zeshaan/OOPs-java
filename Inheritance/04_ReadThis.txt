    Before writng programs for inheritance,you must understand Rules for Multiple Classes in a Single File:-

        1.Only One Public Class: If a file contains multiple classes, only one class can be public, 
        and the file name must match that class.

        2.Non-Public Classes: Other classes in the file should not be declared as public but it can be
         default, private, or protected.

        3.Executing the Program: The public class should contain the main() method, as thatâ€™s where execution starts.
