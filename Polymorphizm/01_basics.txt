Poly-Morphism
Poly means Many,Morphism means ways to represent.


A man can be the following as per the situation

        |->Software Development Engineer
        |->Driver of his own car 
        |->Husband
MAN-----|->Father
        |->Son 
        |->GrandSon

A man can perform/behave differently as per the situation.

Similarly,ability of an entity(an object,or a method or a function) to take up multiple roles/behaviours is called as polymorphism.

TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM
                1.Static or complie time polymorphism
                2.Dynamic or Run time polymorphism

NOTE:Polymorphism is applies only to methods,not to attributes
